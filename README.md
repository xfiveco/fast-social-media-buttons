# Lighting-Fast Social Media Buttons with Counters

Check out our tutorial showing how to create [fast social media buttons with counters](#) with just **1 request** and **3kB of code**.

See the result at the **[demo page](#)**.

Some parts in this repository are not related to the social media buttons themselves, but rather itâ€™s a custom build workflow of this project (probably irrelevant in your project). The following parts are referred in the tutorial:

- [HTML code with SVG symbols](https://github.com/xfiveco/fast-social-media-buttons/blob/master/index.html)
- [JavaScript code for querying SharedCount.com](http://)
- [SCSS styles](https://github.com/xfiveco/fast-social-media-buttons/blob/master/assets/scss/_components.share-buttons.scss)

JavaScript and SCSS code can be rewritten to whatever approach you are comfortable with.
